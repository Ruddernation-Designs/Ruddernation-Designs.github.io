## I've now added live demos of some of my software below.
Hosted domain for all repositories on GitHub,

# tinychat-html-embed
Allows you to embed a TinyChat room in to a web page using my chat script,
This will also embed into almost any CMS by simply removing the relevant tags.
Just change the room name from ruddernation to your room, also update the urlsuper to your domain for sharing,
This has youtube and smileys enabled.

# javascript-colour-changer-using-pad
This allows you to change the colour of the background of a website page or item,
This version uses pad so is slightly different than the one above, But does the same job.<br />

# video-background-using-html5
Simple demo to show how to display a video as your background image on a website with HTML5,
I've added the correctly formatted video files for each browser and if on a older browser it will simple show the image provided.<br />

# html5-contact-form-with-Google-maps
This is a PHP contact form in HTML5/CSS3 with Google maps using the canvas feature,
This uses the Modernizr and Bootstrap features meaning that this contact form is fully responsive.

This is ready for instant use once you change the email addresses in the contact.php in the core folder,
It can be used as a full page or embed into a existing page, 
Just simply remove the relevant tags and do a few css updates to make it fit the page or with your themes style.

I've also only added the most basic of information needed from the contact form, you could also include location/time/referrer etc, I've also added a few html tags that will be stripped inside the form, you can add more if you wish, This is to combat against XSS attacks.

This version is a live version but does not include the PHP file as that does not run on GitHub, But everything works as it's suppose to.<br />

# CSS3-contact-form
This another contact form that is easy to use and is customised in CSS3 and Ajax,
This form will popup on click of link/button and has a dropdown feature for enquiries ect,

This is now ready for using, I've added basic enquiry info in to the form, You can change that to anything you wish, It's just an example of what can be done with it,
I've also added most of the security features to the main javascript file so it'll remove the most malicious tags.
